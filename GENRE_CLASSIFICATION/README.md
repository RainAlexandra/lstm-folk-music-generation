# Evaluation
Human evaluation was used as a way to evaluate the validity of the generated samples: Are they musical to the human ear? Results were mainly positive.

Genre classification was used to automatically evaluate the validity of the generated tunes. The goal was to have as many generated tunes as possible classified as 'folk' music.
