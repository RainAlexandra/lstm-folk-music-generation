# Music Generation Using Deep Learning

This project involves the implementation of a music generating model trained by a Long Short-Term Memory artificial neural network. The final model generates music which displays characteristics common in that of the folk music genre:

* **monophonic**, a simple melody without any accompanying harmony or chords
* of the **AABB form** (binary form) which represents the repetition of a melody *A* and a melody *B*
* **ends on the tonic**, if the key of a song is in G, the song should end with a G note

Music in general is the result of a sequence of musical notes played and organised within a length of time. In this way, music is structured and sequential, much like natural language, where musical notes are words and measures are sentences.
The final generator is a result of data preparation, data processing, and neural network training, all implemented in Python.
